# CS32 Project 2 Test

This project is dedicated to the testing of project 2 in CS32


### DISCLAIMER

This test implements most of the requirements as specified in
the project specification, along with additional components
to test your project more thoroughly.
However, passing this test does not guarantee that your code
is entirely correct or will pass the Smallberg's test. It
serves merely as a reassurance that your code should be correct.
It might produce output helpful for debugging your code.

The code itself is written by mortals, and therefore it might
contain bugs. If you think your code is definitely correct,
but does not pass the test, please create an issue, or send
an email to the author with a simple explanation of why
the test is not working.

Because the test might automatically clean up itself after
finishing the test, it might accidentally clean up things that
it shouldn't, if you have not followed the requirements in
the project specification or the instructions for running this
test. Therefore, it is **STRONGLY ADVISED** to make a backup
of your code before running the test.

Running the test is entirely the person's own will. The author
does not take any responsibility in case of any accident.


### Running the test

All code are expected to run in command line under
a \*nix system.

First, navigate to the directory where all your source files
are located

`cd path/to/source/`

Second, clone this repository

`git clone https://github.com/colinxy/cs32-proj2-test.git`

Then, cd into this directory

`cd cs32-proj2-test`

and to execute it, first make it executable

`chmod +x run_test.sh`

and run it with

`./run_test.sh`

If the test output ends with two lines,

```
Passed all tests
Passed all tests

****** All Test Passed ******
```

your code passes the test. Be sure to read
the error message carefully as it contains
useful information for debugging your code.
